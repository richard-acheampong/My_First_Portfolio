        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Richard Acheampong—a ministry leader, creative systems builder, and media strategist based in Kpone, Ghana.</p> 
        <p>My work sits at the intersection of faith, design, and digital innovation.</p> 
        <p>I thrive in environments where story meets structure, and where clarity isn’t just a goal—it’s a discipline.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve led worship movements, coordinated creative residencies, managed media platforms, and facilitated teaching ministries.</p> 
        <p>My contributions span spiritual formation, digital storytelling, and scalable leadership systems.</p> 
        <p>Whether guiding a team, designing a user interface, or delivering a message, I focus on creating experiences that move hearts and sharpen minds.</p> 
        <p>>My approach is rooted in African visual heritage, systems thinking, and a commitment to sustainable impact.</p>
        <p>I’m currently deepening my front-end development skills through the ALX program and refining my public speaking through Toastmasters.</p> 
        <p>These disciplines complement my work in building intuitive platforms, leading creative teams, and mentoring others. I believe in designing systems that outlive me and stories that outlast trends—whether through code, worship, or community engagement.</p>
